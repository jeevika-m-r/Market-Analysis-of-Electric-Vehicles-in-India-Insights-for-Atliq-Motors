## Market-Analysis-of-Electric-Vehicles-in-India-Insights-for-Atliq-Motors

### *Project Overview:*

AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in the electric and hybrid vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study of the existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further.

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed the Indian EV market and provided insights to the company so they could take an informed decision.
